[RobRecSolver](https://github.com/nikagra/RobRecSolver.jl) is a package written in a Julia programming language developed
to test performance of algorithms proposed in _Robust recoverable 0-1 optimization
problems under polyhedral uncertainty_ (Mikita Hradovich, Adam Kasperski, Pawel Zielinski)
which is available as preprint on [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06719).
This work will later be referenced as _publication_.
